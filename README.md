Full stack practice project.

CrateMate will be a tracklist builder with harmonic Camelot notation harmonic mixing hints as well as suggestions based on what 
other people are playing in their sets with your favourite tracks!

This will grow to be a full MVP clean architecture, Dagger2, RxJava Android demo.
This will use Scala backend microservices, Docker, AWS EC2, AWS Cognito, AWS API-Gateway and social integration. 
Maybe even a web frontend, JavaScript is the devil but lets go big!

Doing is learning, baby!
